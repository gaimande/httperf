To generate the TR-069 template for testing, please following these instructions:
	1. Capturing desired TR-069 session from CPE side using tcpdump.
		tcpdump -s 0 -i eth0 port 7547 src 192.168.1.100 -w tr69.pcap
	2. Using Wireshark to extract the HTTP packets from the above pcap file.
		File > Export Objects > HTTP
	3. Each HTTP packets will be exported to a file, named with right order.
	   We have to merge them to one file.
		ls -vQ http* | xargs cat > tr69.http
	4. Use the tr69gen application to build the cwmp template file, named output.
		tr69gen tr69.http
	5. Remove the leading space characters in the first line.
	6. Adding this line in the second line of the output file.
		/ method=POST contents=""
	7. That's all.
